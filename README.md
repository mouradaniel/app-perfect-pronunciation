  Perfect Pronunciation

The idea of the project is to assist in <strong>practicing the Listen</strong> of a language.<br>
I created a POC in July 2021, when practicing React Native.

## The POC contains:
- Ability to type a word/text in Portuguese.
- Listening to the word/text read in British and/or American English.

### So the first commit is the final result of the POC.

### And now I will start improving the code of this old implementation.
